My contractor project will be Spacebnb: Airbnb, but for planets.

You can make an account, browse listings, put up your own, and choose a planet to stay on.

It's useful for anyone who happens to be travelling through the solar system who forgot to book a place ahead of time, or as an alternative to other temporary residences.

It also allows people with extra space to rent it out for a bit of cash on the side.
